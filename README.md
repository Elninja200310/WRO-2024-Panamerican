Regarding the creation of the robot, first, we searched for the main parts, including a base that was used as the support for the robot's core. Then, the robot was positioned horizontally and we looked for the engines. These were programmed for proper functioning. Once the code was created, we searched for the parts to make the wheels. With the core and the wheel parts ready, a vote was held to determine what type of view to use, whether block view or ground view. The block view sensor was chosen. Subsequently, there were several days of trial and error to find the correct code. We also added supports for the engines and sensor wiring, as well as some sensors capable of detecting walls. Failures occurred, but we managed to fix them, and in the end, we met our expectations.

Thank you for your attention
