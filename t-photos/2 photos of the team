## Content

* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members)
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. It may include documentation how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.

## Introduction 

Regarding the creation of the robot, first, we searched for the main parts, including a base that was used as the support for the robot's core. Then, the robot was positioned horizontally and we looked for the engines. These were programmed for proper functioning. Once the code was created, we searched for the parts to make the wheels. With the core and the wheel parts ready, a vote was held to determine what type of view to use, whether block view or ground view. The block view sensor was chosen. Subsequently, there were several days of trial and error to find the correct code. We also added supports for the engines and sensor wiring, as well as some sensors capable of detecting walls. Failures occurred, but we managed to fix them, and in the end, we met our expectations.
